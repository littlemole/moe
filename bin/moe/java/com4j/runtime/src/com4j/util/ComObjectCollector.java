/**
 * {@link ComObjectListener} implementation that collects all
 * newly created {@link Com4jObject}s
 *
 * <p>
 * The intended use of this class is to record objects created
 * in a certain block and then dipose them all (except a few marked explicitly)
 * at once at some later point.
 *
 * <p>
 * See the following code example for a typical usage:
 * <pre>
 * <pre class=code>
    void foo() {
        // we will start using COM objects.
        // so we'll register the listener and start keeping
        // track of COM objects we create.
        ComObjectCollector col = new ComObjectCollector();
        COM4J.addListener(col);

        try {
            // use COM objects as much as you want
            IFoo foo = doALotOfComStuff();

            // do this to avoid COM objects from disposed by the diposeAll method.
            col.remove(foo);
        } finally {
            // dipose all the COM objects created in this thread
            // since the listener is registered.
            // But "foo" won't be diposed because of the remove method.
            col.disposeAll();

            // make sure to remove the listener
            COM4J.removeListener(col);
